I'm Haoxuan Yu, a first-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). Iâ€™m supervised by [Prof. Wei Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/). Prior to that, I received my BEng degree in Computer Science from the [School of the Gifted Young](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2022. My research interests include machine learning system and cloud computing. Currently I am trying to build high-performance ML serving system with TVM.
